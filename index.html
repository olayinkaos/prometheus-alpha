	<p>Our Prometheus coach has given us the right to rant on this platform so that's kinda nice. I will rather just type whatever comes to mind. What do I want to talk about now oo.... <br>
	Like Zira, I will list the memebers of the group namely: Ayoola, Benn, Dotun, Olajire, Shiewhun, Tochukwu, Zira and me. Is it long enough now?</p>

	<p>From 9am till 4pm in Uyo is as hot as mid day</p>

	<q>Valar Morghulis is a common greeting in Braavos, meaning "all men must die" in High Valyrian.

The customary response is Valar Dohaeris â€” "all men must serve."<br> <br>Now that been said... Aurevior</q>
