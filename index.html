        <h3> Fashion Police </h3>
    <p>Not afraid to go the full double denim if getting dressed for a night out. Jeans are probably a little too tight for a 55-year-old, but then if you’ve got it, flaunt it, baby.

Doesn’t own a suit. Doesn’t own a tie. Doesn’t own a watch. Appears to buy all his clothes from car boots and charity shops for almost no money. Passes this choice off as part of his stand against the capitalist consumer culture, but is really just skint. 
Hair clearly hasn’t seen a hairdresser, possibly ever. Probably spends too much time worrying about his bald spot, and rightly so. It’s a suspiciously dark, raggy mop for a man of his age, which suggests he’s in denial about being middle-aged and fears that death’s icy breath is upon his neck at all times.

<h3> Lingo Bingo </h3>
    <p> Sometimes just seems to be making noises with his mouth, but apparently it is a version of the English language. Has one of those distinctive is-he-actually-drunk? slack-jawed, slightly slurring Teesside accents that outsiders always mistake for Geordie, a fact that must surely cause him severe ire. Prone to draw out a vowel and in doing so, make any word three times as long. ‘Taking’ becomes ‘taaakn’, ‘avocado’ is ‘avaahcaahdoh’, ‘Boro’ is ‘burrah’. Might also drop in local colloquialisms such as ‘owee’ or ‘maftin” to flag up his heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Public outings in the media largely involve making things up on the spot without any prior thought. Often seems to begin sentences with no idea what he’s going to say next. Apparently, he has done book talks for up to two hours non-stop, until people were begging him to stop and be let out of the room. Trying to make people laugh is his primary way of seeking approval and gaining self-worth, feeling that if you’re going to take anything seriously, you need to be able to laugh at it first. Not a bad premise to work from.
