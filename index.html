    <h1>My ideal Woman</h1>
    <p>Zira do not laugh or disclose any of this information</p>
    <p>Check out this excerpt from my former blog <br></p>
    <p>It’s Paris

We were finally able to get away from our busy schedules to attend to the trip that we had spent so much time discussing and fantasizing about.<br>
You sunk into a deep sleep as soon as you felt how soft the bed was.<br>
I chuckled whilst heading out for a quick glass of wine.<br>
I decided to play some music to help me with the unpacking and Najee’s can’t stop love comes on.<br>
Talk about coincidence.<br>

<h1>A tribute to the women i have hurt</h1>
<p>Again, Zira..this shit is CONFIDENTIAL</p>
<p>the watcher on my wall.<br>
The balm for my sore <br>
The best outta the rest <br>
The sanity to my insanity <br>
The calm in the storm <br>
The angel that sits on my shoulder <br>
My hallelujah cry <br>
She is T, my favorite alphabet <br>
She is also Tee, I prefer her hot please <br>

<h1>To the one who cheated on me</h1>
<p>Zira, you gonn have to sign a confidentiality agreement babes</p>
<p>Amir, why are you not looking at me?<br>
Amir!<br>
My eyes scuttled from her shoes to meet a very stern gaze from the woman I loved <br>
Hi Jessica <br>
I find it hard to believe that we can still hold a proper conversation after all that happened <br>
After the words I said, and the tears I shed <br>
After the heartbreak and most importantly, the betrayal <br>
But here I am <br>
Standing less than 5ft. away from you <br>
Fighting the urge in my body to draw you close and kiss you with all the passion my weary body can muster <br>
