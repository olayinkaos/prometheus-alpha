<h1>Welcome to My World</h1>
<p>My name is Dotun Jolaoso. I studied Computer Engineering at Covenant University. I'm from Nigeria and would to love share some details about my country with you.</p>

<h2> Did you know that?</h2>
<p> Nigeria is a country in West Africa having boundaries with Niger and Chad Republic in the north, Cameroon on the eastern part, Benin Republic on the western border and the Atlantic ocean at the southern end. </p>

<h2>Most Populous country in Africa</h2>
<p>Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with more than 160 million people living here. What this means is that one in every 7 Africans is a Nigerian. </p>

<h2> What's the difference between an ID and a Class? </h2>
<p> ID's are unique in the sense that each element can be tied to only one id, whereas the same class can be used on multiple elements. </p>
