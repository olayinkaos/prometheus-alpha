Hello Everyone, my name is Dotun Jolaoso. I've always wanted to learn coding but never fully gotten around to learn it properly. I hope this is the time! I have little knowledge of HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
Presently serving my country in the form of NYSC. Hope to learn and work on great things with everybody here, cheers!
